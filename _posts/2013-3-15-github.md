### Github 的诞生

if you love CVS, you should be in some mential institution.
If you are not distributed, you are not worth using. --Linus on choosing VCS
linus distribution slide.

I do open source because I think its the only right way to do software.

Defination of Distribution: You don't have one central location to track you
data, no single place is more important than any other single place.


1. What distribution gives you?
   1. work offline
   1. very fast
      http://git-scm.com/about/small-and-fast
      1. not having to go over network for things (expect push and pull)
      1. because it's fast, you can do a lot of cool things with git, git
blame xxx
   1. real cheap branch
      1. this can aid invididual developers to gain effcience.
         1. show people a real example: scoot chcoon website case
   1. optimized merging.

1. when new staff join the team
   1. he can just fork, and start to send PR
   1. you don't have to give him commit access first.
   1. so openSource projects should use distributed system

1. git support angile very well. This is a hugely better development model.
   1. small incrimential development
      1. check TODO with github network tag
   1. if you use Centrilized system, you tend to work on sth for two weeks and
then commit. Then with git, you have all the branches for each developer,
everybody playing with their HEAD, you can check each other's work often, you
can merge often( to reduce merge conflicts), you can release ofen as well.
    1. if commit is expensive, people won't do it often, so there will be
three people working on things, they can not see each other's progress, so at
then end of the day, huge commits tend to bring horriable conflicts or
problems.

1. 分布式，对于员工肉身也分布式的 team 尤为实用。github has 2/3 staff work
remotely.

Github 应该说是版本控制工具 git 和 web 开发框架 RubyOnRails
的结合。所以它的诞生也可以由此分两条线来分析。

Git
这边来说，就是从我们的行业混沌初开的时候，出了个人叫 RMS
提出了自由软件这个概念。这是在80年代。到了91年，芬兰的大学在校生 linus 发起了
Linux 这个项目，到了 2005 年他写作了 git，这里就是一个很重要的背景，git
是一个坚信开源的人(I do open source, cause its the only right way to do
software--Linus)，十几年管理庞大团队，复杂项目的经验的结晶。

Rails 的诞生，源自于人们对 Java 的厌恶。

Git + Rails = Github，是黑客精深和电子商务，SNS 等这些 Web 思潮结合的产物。

结语：分布意味者效率, 民主。
