I had my second coding for fun last Saturday, it was nice.

I showed a driver developer how to use git, when he said since he did not
write a lot of code, git tips I gave was not very useful. But he was
interested in my `gd`&`<c-o>` trick to read Makefiles. He showed me his 
<http://www.armux.org/index.php/> and how to acquire a domain name at
<xinnet.com>, that was really helpful.

Since I am building my own website and blog, I wanted those from my peers
there, <http://www.vincnd.com/> is nice one.

Late in that afternoon, a big guy from Canonical gave a talk on Arm Ubuntu, I
wish stable device be available soon, that way I can do not need to learn a
new platform like Andriod or IOS, most my desktop ubuntu conf skills can be
used on my Handheld device.

Good friends, cozy place, meaningful conversations. Interested? Head for
Beijinglug.org, find out when is the nice one and feel free to join us.
