These days, I am learning [Ruby on Rails][ror].

## Because I want to do things my own way

Building my [happypeter.org][ho], basically I want to share my screencasts and
have a [HackerNews][hn]-like forum, so that people can come, see, and talk.
People introduced things like [phpBB][bb], well, it is far from what I
wanted quite frankly, since it has a lot of feathers I don't love or need.
Hey, I am a coder, so I do not mind learning a whole new [framework][fw] to do the
code from scratch.

## So why Ruby on Rails, not other framework like [Django][dj] or java?

It's all because [github][gh], I love it, it was built on rails, and I also
love some other neat tools like [showoff][sf] and [jekyll][jk], anyway it
looked charming and promising. So I did not even give Django a try, even I
have some python skills while knows nothing about [Ruby][ry] language.

## Is it a right decision?

Yes, I was right, and it is even gets righter with my study continues.

I started with [a official guide][off], quite a good place to start from ZERO.

Then I find [RailsforZombies][rfz], and I've never seen some cooler screencasts
before, again, it is definitely friendly for absolute beginners like me.

When I had the very basic concepts in hand and really want to do some real
code, I found [railscasts.com][rc]. __Episode 250:__ _Authentication from
Scratch_, was really a big help.

## It is fun

I am feeling good learning, I love the RoR community, interesting and
passionate people here. But if you do not have basic command line skills, like
you never heard off what a _shell script_ is, you may have less joyful
learning process. RoR is a typical Unix toy, it gets really naughty on
Windows.


BTW, knowing [git-scm][git] is also a big bonus to make the learning process
exciting.
