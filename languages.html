<h2>C</h2>
<b>2002</b>had a course on C, and hated it because nobody told me what it was
for.
<br>
<b>2007</b>Picked C up agiain, for ARM development.

<h2>C++</h2>
<b>2008</b>After working on kernel space for nearly a year, and wrote some
simple drivers for S3C2410 chip, I want a gui program in order to manipulate the
driver with the touch screen of my handhold device. Qt was at that
time the only thing I knew, so I tried some Qt code, and soon got confused by
all the differences that C++ brought over C, that drove me to start my
journey with C++.
<h2>PHP</h2>
<h2>HTML</h2>
<h2>Python</h2>
<b>2009</b> Asianux(the company I was working for at that time) made a
decision to switch from its own system updater(axtu) to YUM, as at that time the
only axtu developer in the company, I need to join YUM development, that's
how I started to learn and use Python.
<h2>Bash</h2>
<h2>Make</h2>
<h2>Java</h2>
<b>2002</b>My cusion Aric Zhou(now employee of IBM) was at that time studying
in Tsinghua Unversity. I stayed in his dorm for a couple of weeks for my own
business. One day I saw a big book on Java, and Aric told me if you try to
learn this, you will feel the knowleadge is overwhelming, meaning so much you
need to remeber. But I was not scared, I always am good at rembering things
myslef... but anyway, I thing that's the first time I heard the name Java.
<b>2005</b>Aric told me that he met James Gosling.
<b>2008</b>attended a presentation by a smart teacher, teaching me how to draw
a turtle with Java, I liked it, but that did not persuade me to start to learn
this language.
<b>2009</b>was told that Google Adriod was built with Java, and I got shocked,
since I always tought Java as a scripting langauge is not fast enough for
embedded use. But Google just did it, and solve some problems by maintaining
their own branch of Java Libs.
<b>2010.7</b>never wrote a single line of Java code till now, and have not
read much either.
