<b>2002</b>had a course on C, and hated it because nobody told me what it was

<b>2002</b>My cusion Aric Zhou(now employee of IBM) was at that time studying
in Tsinghua Unversity. I stayed in his dorm for a couple of weeks for my own
business. One day I saw a big book on Java, and Aric told me if you try to
learn this, you will feel the knowleadge is overwhelming, meaning so much you
need to remeber. But I was not scared, I always am good at rembering things
myslef... but anyway, I thing that's the first time I heard the name Java.
<b>2005</b>Aric told me he met James Gosling.
<b>2008</b>attended a presentation by a smart teacher, teaching me how to draw
a turtle with Java, I liked it, but that did not persuade me to start to learn
this language.
<b>2009</b>was told that Google Adriod was build with Java, and I got shocked,
since I always tought Java as a scripting langauge is not fast enough for
embeded use. But Google just did it, and solve some problems by maintaining
their own branch of Java Libs.
<b>2010.7</b>never wrote a single line of Java code till now, and have not
read much either.
